Hi, I'm George!

Since 2014, I have been building <a href="https://www.soroco.com">Soroco</a>. Our technology helps teams in enterprise organizations understand how work is done at scale, with empathy. To enable this, we have built the <a href="https://soroco.com/work-graph/">work graph</a>; a map of how teams execute digital work, and it lies at the intersection of people, work, and technology (see: <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/10/monitoring-individual-employees-isnt-the-way-to-boost-productivity">Harvard Business Review</a>). As a co-founder of Soroco, I have had the opportunity to build scalable systems, algorithms, intellectual property, product designs, teams, and relationships with many of our employees and customers who I continually learn from. 

In 2013, I completed my Ph.D. from <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a> advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srini/">Srinivasan Seshan</a> (CMU C.S. Department Head) and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~prs/">Peter Steenkiste</a>. During my time as a student I spent two summers at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a>, and collaborated with many amazing people in academia and research labs to publish advancements in networks, distributed systems, and security in top-tier ACM and IEEE conferences (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RuqwAYQAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a>).

When I am not hacking away at Soroco, I am typically building small technology projects for the purpose of learning. Most of these projects accomplish something helpful for me but are more for helping me learn new things by incorporating aspects of distributed systems, statistical techniques, image processing, cloud technologies, and efficient software delivery. Running bare metal, a Kubernetes cluster, and full CI/CD pipelines within my home are all part of making this kind of learning happen.

<i>Finally...</i> family, friends, and technology are big parts of me. All of which continue to inspire and motivate me in their own ways. Being personal, personable, passionate, and compassionate are how I live and work.
