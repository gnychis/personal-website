My colleague's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohan-murty-844695b2">Rohan Murty</a> and <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/shreyas-karanth-12600912b">Shreyas Karanth</a> published an <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/10/monitoring-individual-employees-isnt-the-way-to-boost-productivity">amazing HBR article</a> on how the work graph focuses on how team's work with empathy. Not on "squeezing" the individual.
